## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A supported NVIDIA RTX 50 Series GPU
- Windows 10/11 or a modern Linux distribution
- Admin/root privileges

### Installation

1. **Download** the latest version from [TechPowerUp](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/nvidia-nvflash/)
2. **Extract** the archive to a folder
3. **Backup your current vBIOS**
   ```bash
   nvflash --save backup.rom
   ```
4. **Disable write protection (if enabled)**
   ```bash
   nvflash --protectoff
   ```
5. **Flash new BIOS**
   ```bash
   nvflash -6 newbios.rom
   ```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Flashing your GPU BIOS can brick your graphics card. Always create a backup first and proceed only if you understand the risks.

The `-6` flag forces flashing even if Board ID mismatches occur. Make sure you are flashing a compatible BIOS for your exact GPU. For recovery, a backup BIOS and secondary GPU are recommended.
